    <!-- Quick start -->
    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the React documentation! This page will give you an introduction to 80% of the React concepts that you
        will use on a daily basis.</p>

    <!-- Creating and nesting components -->
    <h2>Creating and nesting components</h2>
    <p>React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic
        and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.</p>
    <p>React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:</p>

    <p>Now that you’ve declared MyButton, you can nest it into another component:</p>

    <p>Notice that
        <MyButton /> starts with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React component. React component names
        must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

        Have a look at the result:
    </p>

    <!-- Writing markup with JSX  -->
    <h2>Writing markup with JSX</h2>
    <p>The markup syntax you’ve seen above is called JSX. It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its
        convenience. All of the <a href="https://react.dev/learn/installation">tools we recommend for local
            development</a> support JSX out of the box.</p>

    <p>JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX
        tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a
    <div>...</div> or an empty <> . . . < /> wrapper:</p>

            <!-- Adding styles -->
            <h2>Adding styles</h2>
            <p>In React, you specify a CSS class with className. It works the same way as the HTML <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class">class</a>
                attribute:</p>



            <!-- Displaying data -->
            <h2>Displaying data</h2>
            <p>JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you
                can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user. For example, this will display
                user.name:</p>
                <p>You can also “escape into JavaScript” from JSX attributes, but you have to use curly braces instead of quotes. For example, className="avatar" passes the "avatar" string as the CSS class, but src={user.imageUrl} reads the JavaScript user.imageUrl variable value, and then passes that value as the src attribute:</p>
